Solana Raydium Trade Listener

Solana Raydium Trade Listener is a real-time utility for monitoring and parsing Raydium swaps on the Solana blockchain. By subscribing to or polling new blocks, this tool identifies transactions involving Raydium’s PROGRAM_ID, decodes them into a user-friendly format, and exports the data for further analysis or integration into trading bots, dashboards, or ML pipelines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features

- Block Monitoring
  Continuously fetches new blocks from Solana mainnet to stay current with the latest trades.

- Raydium Swap Decoding
  Searches for Raydium swap instructions, extracting relevant info into a TradeData struct.

- Structured Trade Data
  Outputs uniform fields:
      Block Date, Block Time, Block Slot, Signature, Tx Id, Signer,
      Pool Address, Base Mint, Quote Mint, Base Vault, Quote Vault,
      Base Amount, Quote Amount, Is Inner Instruction,
      Instruction Index, Instruction Type

- Flexible Integration
  Acts as a backbone for Telegram bots, analytics dashboards, machine learning services, or real-time trading platforms.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-raydium-listener.git
   cd solana-raydium-listener

2. Install Rust (if you haven’t already)
   Rust Installation Guide: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
   Make sure you can run `cargo --version` in your terminal.

3. Build and Run
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release

   Or simply:
   cargo run

   This starts the application, which immediately begins fetching the latest blocks and decoding Raydium swaps.

4. Configure
   - By default, the app may point to the mainnet RPC endpoint (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com).
   - You can change the RPC or other settings in the code (or through environment variables if supported).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage Example

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let rpc_url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com";

    // Instantiate and run the trade listener
    let mut listener = TradeListener::new(rpc_url);
    listener.run().await?;

    Ok(())
}

Here’s the essence of what the tool does under the hood:
- Connects to a Solana RPC endpoint
- Fetches/polls new blocks
- Decodes Raydium swap instructions
- Outputs TradeData logs or CSV rows you can feed into bots, dashboards, or ML workflows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Limitations

- Inner Instructions
  Transactions routed via aggregators (e.g., Jupiter) are not yet fully decoded. This feature is under development.

- Performance
  For large-scale usage or extremely high throughput, you may need more concurrency, batching, or other optimizations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roadmap

1. Inner Instruction Support (Jupiter, etc.)
2. Enhanced Export Options (e.g., direct database integration, more file formats)
3. Performance Tuning for ultra-high-volume block flows
